Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of projects I have worked on, ranging from simple web applications to complex full-stack projects. Each project comes with a detailed README file, explaining the project's purpose, the tools used, and how to run it locally.

Some of the technologies and frameworks that I have experience with include:

Front-end development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, Bootstrap
Back-end development: Node.js, Express, Flask, Django, Ruby on Rails
Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase
Deployment: AWS, Heroku, Netlify, Firebase Hosting, Vercel
